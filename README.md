## üöÄ  Some Tools Used For The Project

vscode, pandas, numpy, python, jupyter

## Process
- Pull data from remote database with pyodbc; save as csv files

- Develop questions and a hypothesis to base analysis of the project on

- Understand the data and make decisions on how to process the data

- Data preprocessing, cleaning and merging- The data was very messy and 90% of the project involved cleaning and making the data ready for analysis and visualizations

- Visualise the data with seaborn and pyplot

- Created a PowerBI dashboard with the visualizations

- Wrote a medium article and briefly described the process, findings and recommendations
